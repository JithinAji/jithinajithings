    What is the difference between like and love?<br />
    I like my Xiaomi Notebook,<br />
    but I love my MacBook Air M4!

  <p id="blamegame">
    To blame others is to be human.<br />
    To blame God is to be philosophical.<br />
    To see no fault in yourself — that is either divine peace or perfect
    delusion.<br />
    But to blame yourself…<br />
    That is the cruelest trick of all — <br />
    because you become both the prisoner and the jailer.<br />
    And call it justice.

    It’s hard to decide what’s worse: to be a moron who generates a quote with
    ChatGPT and posts something clearly not their own, or to be a
    fool—stubborn enough to be left behind for ego’s sake.

  <p>PS: Edited by ChatGPT.</p>

    If a crow crashes into the back of your head at 5 o’clock in the morning,
    and you don’t get angry but choose to forgive him/her/they/them/it— it’s
    not because you’re enlightened. It’s because you assume they can’t see in
    the dark.

    Jaggu brings juicy, sweet, ripe bananas for you everyday. He did this for
    a decade. One day he brings a stinky, slimy, yuck banana. Now you hate
    Jaggu. Jaggu doesn't deserve you. You don't deserve Jaggu.
